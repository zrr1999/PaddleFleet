#
# On SM100+ the kernel takes the query-head count as its MMA ``M``

# single tile and any multiple of 64 above that. Padding there would only buy
# wasted MMA rows, so the width is computed per device.

    tile, so in practice it never fires below a tile and the caller pads.

    ``dsa_bwd_sm100.py`` requires ``num_head % 64 == 0`` and does not check it:

      as ``(b, h, round_up(q, 8), 8)`` and splits it into back-to-back

      slack**, with ``scaled_lse`` ending at the allocation end.
    * Both views declare ``cute.assume(H, divby=64)`` (``:229``/``:233``).
      Violating a ``cute.assume`` is UB, not an error: a dynamic ``Integer``
      goes to ``ConstrainedIntType`` unchecked, so the kernel compiles happily.
    * ``:1176-1207`` tiles the **head** mode by 64 (``cute.flat_divide``, see

      only 96 B of each tile is in bounds, so the last query token reads 160 B
      and the second-to-last 64 B past the end of the allocation.

    It is an out-of-bounds **read**, so results stay correct (shape-preserving
    canaries on both workspaces come back untouched and ``dq`` is
    bit-identical); the failure mode is ``CUDA error(700)`` whenever those
    160 B happen to land on an unmapped page. That depends only on the
    allocator layout -- deterministic per layout, a lottery across layouts --
    which is why short runs can look clean while the access is always OOB.

    fault, ``H`` 64 / 128 pass even with zero mapped headroom.
    Odd ``H`` is the same access failing earlier, at 8-byte alignment
    (``CUDA 716``), and is covered by the same condition.

    Revert to ``num_heads % 2 == 0`` once the kernel either predicates those
    two tile loads or over-allocates ``workspace_LSE_OdO`` (bumping its ``q``
    extent by 64 -- 12 KiB at ``H=24`` -- is enough; both fixes were verified

    Compaction is *order-preserving*: valid entries keep their original
    left-to-right order (holes are just removed). Although the backward is
    set-based (dq/softmax are reductions over the key set, dkv scatters by global
    index), preserving order keeps the kept terms in the same accumulation
    sequence as the un-compacted layout, and holes contribute exact ``0.0``, so
    dq/out/lse stay bit-identical -- a value-sort would instead reorder them and
    drift in the last bits. Empty rows get ``topk_length == 0`` and hit the
    kernel's empty-row fast path. It must NOT clip to a minimum: clipping to 1
    would leave a ``-1`` at column 0 and reintroduce the ``mKV[-1]`` gather.

    (``dsa_bwd_sm100.py``). The SM90 kernel has no such guard: for ``topK == 0``
    it computes ``n_block = n_block_max - 1 = -1`` and still runs the first-block

            ``_csa_compact_topk_idxs`` produces). Only consulted together with
            ``topk_length`` on the "cudnn" backend, where it lets the backward
            keep the compact KV-load path; that path gathers ``mKV[-1]`` on an
            interior hole, so it defaults to False and the backward then takes
            the guarded full-width path instead. When ``topk_length`` is None
            this layer compacts on its own and the flag is irrelevant.
        global_kv_idx_remap_fusion: use the fused Triton local->global KV
            column index remap instead of the eager elementwise chain.
            Bit-identical either way; wired from the
            ``sparse_attn_global_kv_idx_remap_fusion`` config field. Only the
            "cudnn" backend builds that table, so it is ignored otherwise.

    ``query`` may carry any head count up to 128 on the "cudnn" backend; counts
    that are not one of the kernel's head tiles (e.g. 32 or 24) are handled
    inside ``CSASparseAttention`` by padding the forward, which is exact but
    keeps the forward cost of the tile. The same holds for the latent width:
    any ``v_head_dim`` up to 512 is accepted and zero-padded to 512, which is
    the only width both the FlashMLA forward and the cuDNN backward exist at.
