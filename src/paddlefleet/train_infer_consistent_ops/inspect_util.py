"""Core tensor probe for train_infer_consistent_inspect (training side).

`inspect_tensor` prints abssum/absmax/md5 per (tag, layer), optionally dumps the
tensor to `.npy` and optionally overrides it with the inference side's dump.

Call sites need no `if inspect_enabled():` wrapper: with `ABLATION_INSPECT_TENSOR`
unset the first statement returns the tensor untouched after reading one cached
module-level bool, and whatever massaging a probe needs (fp8 dequant, row
permutation) is handed over as `pre_save_func` / `post_load_func` so it is not
evaluated either.

The layout helpers live next door, one module per operator family: `permute.py`
for the expert-contiguous row order, `ffn_act.py` for the fused SwiGLU+fp8-quant
activation, `gate.py` for the fused two-view router logits.

Every probe entry point the network is expected to call is named
`inspect_tensor_*`, so grepping that prefix lists the whole surface.

    The training-side fused kernel reads channel pairs ``(2j, 2j+1)`` but writes
    the two results to ``j`` and ``j + rope_dim // 2`` (a **half-split** layout),
    whereas sglang's RoPE writes each result back to the channel it came from (an
    **interleaved** layout). The two layouts differ by a channel permutation
    only::

        interleaved[2j]     == half[j]                    j = 0 .. rope_dim // 2 - 1
        interleaved[2j + 1] == half[j + rope_dim // 2]

    This helper takes the half-split tensor and rebuilds the interleaved one, so
    the training side can be compared against sglang in sglang's own layout.
    Applying it to q_pe and k_pe together leaves ``q . k`` -- and hence the
    attention output -- unchanged, so this is purely a comparison aid.

    ``start`` / ``end`` restrict the permutation to the ``[..., start:end]``
    segment of the last dim, leaving the head ``[..., :start]`` and tail
    ``[..., end:]`` verbatim. This is the ``[nope | rope]`` case: the rope block
    is half-split while the nope block, which RoPE never touches, is passed
    through. The default spans the whole last dim.

    Returns a fresh tensor via ``concat`` rather than writing into ``x``:
    the live buffer is usually still held by the autograd graph, and an
    in-place write bumps its dygraph inplace version and breaks
    backward / recompute.

    Stages: 1 gate -> 2 snapshot -> 3 context -> 4 info -> 5 save -> 6 load ->
    7 return. Stages 4/5/6 share one host float32 copy of the snapshot.

    Controlled by environment variables:
        ABLATION_INSPECT_TENSOR: "1" to enable the probes at all.
        ABLATION_TAG_WHITELIST: comma-separated tags; when set, tags outside the
            list return immediately (no hooks, no info, no save, no
            load). Entries may be `fnmatch` globs (`mhc_*` matches every
            `mhc_`-prefixed tag) or exact tags.
        ABLATION_TAG_BLACKLIST: comma-separated tags to return early on; glob or
            exact, same rule as the whitelist.
        ABLATION_SAVE_TENSOR_PATH: directory to dump `.npy` files into.
        ABLATION_LOAD_TENSOR_PATH: directory with the other side's `.npy` dumps.
        ABLATION_DUMP_SKIP_TAGS: comma-separated tags to skip for saving/loading
            only (they are still printed); glob or exact, same rule.
        ABLATION_INSPECT_DETAIL: "1" to add a per-element diff breakdown on load
            (`[ABLATION_detail]` lines: diff count/ratio, largest abs/rel diff
            with positions, a 1/2/3/>3 bf16 ULP-step ratio table, top divergent
            positions). Printed only when the loaded reference and the live
            snapshot fail to md5-align, so a bit-identical match stays quiet.

    Args:
        tag: identifier for the tensor checkpoint.
        layer_idx: transformer layer index (-1 for embedding / LM head).
        tensor: the live paddle tensor, or a tuple / list / dict holding it when
            `index` is given.
        index: element / key to probe inside `tensor`, handing back a copy of the
            container with only that element replaced -- the `(tensor, bias)`
            bundles fused blocks pass around, without open-coding the
            unwrap/rewrap at every call site. A plain tensor ignores it, so a call
            site whose value is sometimes a bundle and sometimes bare can pass it
            unconditionally. `tensor[index]` being None (an absent bias) aborts
            the probe exactly like `pre_save_func` returning None.
        save: if True, dump the snapshot to a .npy file.
        load: if True, look for the other side's dump and hand it back instead of
            `tensor` when it exists.
        pre_save_func: `tensor -> snapshot`, applied before printing/saving. Use
            it to build the comparable view (dequant, canonical row order) so the
            work is skipped when the probes are off or the tag is filtered out.
            It only feeds the info/save/load side and never the return value.
            Returning None aborts the probe and leaves `tensor` untouched.
        post_load_func: applied to the loaded dump, and only when one was really
            loaded; its result becomes the return value. Use it to fold the dump
            back into the live buffer (the snapshot is a derived view, so the
            caller is the only one who knows how to invert it).

    Returns:
        The loaded dump when one was applied (after `post_load_func` has had its
        chance to invert whatever view `pre_save_func` built), otherwise the input
        `tensor` -- the *same object*, so `result is tensor` is the test for
        "nothing was loaded" (valid only where no `post_load_func` rewraps the
        dump into a fresh container).

        The override is a *return value*, never an in-place write, so a call site
        that drops the result silently downgrades the probe to a print -- every
        overriding call site must rebind. Writing into the live tensor instead
        (`paddle.assign(src, tensor)`) was tried and reverted: it bumps the
        dygraph inplace version of a tensor the autograd graph still holds, and
        backward dies with `PermissionDeniedError: Tensor ... has been modified by
        an inplace operation. Its version is 3 but the expected version is 2`
        (raised from `MatmulGradNode` via `TensorWrapper::check_inplace_version`).
        The flip side is that `paddle.to_tensor` yields `stop_gradient=True`, so
        each applied override cuts the backward chain at that point -- acceptable
        because a train_infer_consistent_inspect run only needs the forward.
