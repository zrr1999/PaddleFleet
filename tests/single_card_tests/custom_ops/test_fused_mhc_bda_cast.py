"""Tests for the h_post_bda cast fusion (``fuse_cast``).

The fusion lets the cuTile h_post_bda kernel take ``original_residual``/``x``
in the residual dtype and widen them to fp32 in-register, instead of the caller
materializing fp32 copies. Three things need to hold:

1. A ``ct.Constant[int]`` guard compiles away, so the un-fused specialization is
   bitwise identical to a kernel written without the widening at all. This is
   what lets one kernel source serve both paths.
2. Widening in-register is bitwise equivalent to widening in Python, for the
   forward output and for the two large gradients.
3. ``high_precision_mhc=False`` is untouched: the caller never widened there, so
   the flag must not reach the kernel.
