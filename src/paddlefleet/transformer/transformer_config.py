    table), which the cache collapses to a dict lookup. Calls that pass
    ``position_ids`` are never cached -- the result then depends on a runtime

    Scope, on purpose: the ``RotaryEmbedding`` instances that attention layers own

      therefore leaves every pre-existing config bit-identical, and the DSA
      indexer, which shares ``fused_apply_rope_half``, keeps this pairing too.
      Choose it for a model trained from scratch with absorption on, or whenever
      no checkpoint has to survive an absorption switch.
    - ``True`` -- pair ``(2k, 2k+1)`` in the absorbed layers only. Choose it when
      loading a checkpoint whose MLA layers were trained unabsorbed under
      ``apply_rope_fusion``, above all when the backbone is frozen and cannot
      adapt.

    A **checkpoint-compatibility** switch, not a performance one: which two
    channels share a frequency decides which frequency each learned channel of
    ``q_b_proj`` / ``kv_a_proj`` gets, so the pairing is part of the meaning of
    those weights.

    An unabsorbed MLA layer under ``apply_rope_fusion`` runs
    ``fused_apply_mla_rope_for_q`` / ``_for_kv``, which pair ``(2k, 2k+1)``.
    Latent MQA makes the ``apply_rope_fusion and not self.mqa_latent`` test
    in ``MLASelfAttention`` fall through, because ``_for_kv`` needs the
    per-head K/V that absorption never materialises, and every path that
    remains pairs
    ``(k, k+half)``. Enabling absorption therefore silently permutes an MLA
    checkpoint's channel-to-frequency map -- harmless where the backbone can
    retrain, not harmless where it cannot (a frozen-backbone indexer warmup
    distils a scrambled attention distribution; see ``train_indexer_only``).

    Set it to keep the pairing across that switch. It reaches both paths: the
    eager one via a per-call ``multi_latent_attention=True`` (passed only when
    this flag is set, so the default path's call is unchanged; the config field
    itself cannot be flipped, since it also drives layer-spec selection and
    position-embedding construction), the fused one via ``adjacent_in=True`` on
    ``fused_apply_rope_half`` / ``fused_rope_cat_key``. Only the gather
    positions move, so the arithmetic, the bf16 rounding and the half-split
    *output* layout are identical and the two paths stay bit-exact with each
    other. Output layout is left at half-split on purpose: it is q/k-symmetric
    and therefore invisible to ``q @ k^T``.

    Pairing is a within-head_dim property, so this is orthogonal to TP, SP, CP,
    PP and EP.

    Inert, and rejected by ``__post_init__``, where it cannot take effect: no
    absorbed layers, or ``gpt_model_use_experimental_version``. Also rejected
    with ``rotary_interleaved``, which expresses the same pairing by building a
    different ``freqs`` layout; combining them would rotate twice. The HCA/CSA
    (``ratio != -2``) layers pair ``(2k, 2k+1)`` already, via

    The sparse-attention backward computes ``d_sink`` analytically because the

    ``"chunkwise"`` (default) cuts the **sequence**, which is what the layer has

    rank, and exchanges a conv halo with its neighbours. Works under any

    backward is a partial sum, and a rank whose local varlen segments do not line
    up with the global 64-token chunk grid re-segments the recurrence.

    ``"headwise"`` cuts the **heads** (Ulysses): before the short conv each rank
    trades its ``[s/cp, all heads]`` slice for ``[s, heads/cp]``, so the conv and
    the recurrence see the *whole* sequence and run with plain single-card

    - ``"mqa_dsa"``: latent MQA -- attention runs on the single shared
      ``kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim`` latent head and a DSA (Lightning)

    Both ``mqa_*`` modes absorb the query against ``kv_b_proj.weight`` at

    new weights are the DSA indexer's; ``"mqa_full_causal"`` adds none at all.

    ``add_full_attention_sink_bias``. No hybrid-specific duplicates.

    ``"mqa_full_causal"`` isolates absorption from sparsity: absorption is
    activation-level and exact, so latent MQA over the *full* causal set is
    mathematically identical to ``"mha"`` and a warm-started run must track the
    MHA run to within kernel noise. Any drift is then attributable to the

    table is ``[b, s, s]`` int32, so memory grows with the square of the sequence
    length (268 MB per layer at ``s=8192``).

    equal everywhere. Only the indexer's rows move -- attention is already
    balanced at a fixed ``index_topk + window`` columns per row, so ``query`` and
    the layer output never travel. Rank ``r`` keeps the chunk it already owns and
    swaps the other with rank ``cp_size-1-r``, which reduces the exchange to a

    ``True`` moves the branch out of the layer. It is sound because the branch is

    PyLayer is an identity on ``output``, and ``csa_indexer_bwd`` never reads

    Requires ``indexer_loss_overlap.register_pipeline_hooks(...)`` on the
