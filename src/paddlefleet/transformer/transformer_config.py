    - ``"mha"`` (default): ``kv_b_proj`` materialises per-head K/V and dense flash
      attention runs on them. Leaving the field unset keeps this behaviour.
    - ``"mqa_dsa"``: latent MQA -- attention runs on the single shared
      ``kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim`` latent head and a DSA (Lightning)
      indexer selects the attended columns (forced local window + top-k).
    - ``"mqa_full_causal"``: latent MQA with no indexer -- attend to the full
      per-document causal set.

    Both ``mqa_*`` modes absorb the query against ``kv_b_proj.weight`` at
    *runtime* (activation level, not weight level), so the parameter layout stays
    byte-identical to ``"mha"`` and an MHA checkpoint loads unchanged. The only
    new weights are the DSA indexer's; ``"mqa_full_causal"`` adds none at all.

    ``"mqa_dsa"`` reuses the model-wide ``index_n_heads`` / ``index_head_dim`` /
    ``index_topk`` (``dsa_index_*`` internally), i.e. the same fields the CSA
    layers already read; a learnable per-head sink comes from the model-wide
    ``add_full_attention_sink_bias``. No hybrid-specific duplicates.

    ``"mqa_full_causal"`` isolates absorption from sparsity: absorption is
    activation-level and exact, so latent MQA over the *full* causal set is
    mathematically identical to ``"mha"`` and a warm-started run must track the
    MHA run to within kernel noise. Any drift is then attributable to the
    absorption or the softmax scale rather than to the top-k selection. Its index
    table is ``[b, s, s]`` int32, so memory grows with the square of the sequence
    length (268 MB per layer at ``s=8192``).

    Terminology: the ``mqa_*`` modes above are *latent MQA* (class
    ``MQALatentAttention``, ``-2`` layers). A ``csa_compress_ratios`` entry of
    ``-1`` is *CSA full-causal MQA* (class ``CompressedSparseAttention``) -- a

    "mqa_full_causal"}`` -- the split only concerns absorption, so it is
    independent of whether an indexer runs.

    ``False``: both absorption weights are sliced out of ``kv_b_proj.weight`` on

    ``[heads * kv_lora_rank, qk_nope_head_dim]`` and
    ``[heads * v_head_dim, kv_lora_rank]``; the 3-D form is recovered per forward
    with a zero-copy reshape. The fold exists because the AOA engine cannot
    change a tensor's rank, so the checkpoint side has to be 2-D. Each side is
    then one grouped Triton GEMM with no slice, no einsum and no transpose.
