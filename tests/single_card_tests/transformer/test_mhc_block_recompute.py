"""Guard for ``RecomputeWithoutOutputManager`` and the mHC block recompute plan.

The manager exists for one reason: a ``RecomputeWithoutOutput`` whose input is
another's output cannot be replayed independently. Discarding an
output empties the alias ``save_for_backward`` kept -- ``detach_variable`` shares
the holder -- so a consumer replayed before its producer reads a cleared tensor.
Replaying in registration order (= forward order) fixes that, because
``_share_buffer_to`` propagates back to the holder-sharing aliases.

So the tests here are mostly about *order*:

  * a producer/consumer chain replayed in forward order reproduces the plain
    gradients bitwise;
  * the same chain replayed in reverse order fails -- which is what makes the
    ordering assertion non-vacuous;
  * the discard is skipped, not half-applied, when the boundary tensor carries no
    gradient, because a discarded-but-unhooked output is unrecoverable.

Plus the pure arithmetic of ``mhc_recompute_block_plan``, which decides who shares
a manager, and the layer-level wiring: exactly one ``[..., n*C]`` residual state
survives a block, and the block's gradients match the plain baseline.
