"""Latent MQA core attention for hybrid MLA layers, with DSA.

``hybrid_mla_attention`` selects which core attention the
``csa_compress_ratios == -2`` (MLA) layers of a ``dsv4_hybrid`` model run, and
within the DSA mode ``dsa_indexer_use_sparse_loss`` selects the training phase.
``MQALatentAttention._phase()`` is the single place that is decided, and each
phase has its own ``_forward_*`` with no loss code shared between them:

* ``"mha"`` -- unchanged dense MLA (MHA); this module is not used.
* ``"mqa_full_causal"`` -> ``_forward_full_causal``. Latent MQA with the indexer
  dropped, attending to the full per-document causal set. Mathematically
  identical to the dense MHA phase, so it isolates the absorption from the
  sparsity for equivalence experiments.
* ``"mqa_dsa"`` + ``dsa_indexer_use_sparse_loss=False`` -> ``_forward_warmup``
  (phase 2, DSA warmup, paired with ``train_indexer_only``). The backbone is
  frozen and the indexer is random, so **neither side uses top-k**: attention
  runs the same full per-document causal set phase 1 did, and the indexer KL
  spans every causal column on both sides, via one ``csa_indexer_topk_fwd``
  call in its documented "full-candidate selection" mode.
* ``"mqa_dsa"`` + ``dsa_indexer_use_sparse_loss=True`` -> ``_forward_sparse``
  (phase 3). A forced local window plus Lightning-indexer top-k, i.e. DeepSeek
  Sparse Attention on the KV latent, with the KL restricted to that same
  selected set. This is the only phase that reads ``index_topk``.

The indexer reuses the model-wide ``index_n_heads`` / ``index_head_dim``.

The two full-causal phases attend over the whole per-document causal span, which
is exactly what the caller's ``attn_mask_startend_row_indices`` already says, so
they run as dense FA4 flashmask (``_dense_attn``), context parallel included.
FA4 is their only backend: ``_assert_dense_fa4`` refuses to start rather than
substitute one that would need an ``O(s^2)`` column table (see
``_dense_attn`` for what that costs). Only phase 3 genuinely selects columns,
and only it builds a table.

Note the ``mqa_*`` modes here are *latent* MQA (this module). A
``csa_compress_ratios`` entry of ``-1`` is *CSA full-causal MQA*, a different
layer kind handled by ``csa_attention.py``.

``MLASelfAttention`` performs the activation-level absorption (see its
``mqa_latent`` flag), so this module receives

    query [b, s, h, kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim]
    key   [b, s, 1, kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim]

and de-absorbs the value side with ``v_b_proj_weight``
(``[kv_lora_rank, h, v_head_dim]``). Every parameter stays byte-identical to
the MHA layout, so an MHA checkpoint loads into an MQA run unchanged.

``add_full_attention_sink_bias`` (or ``softmax_type``) adds one learnable
per-head sink logit as ``softmax_offset``, built by the same
``build_softmax_offset`` helper ``DotProductAttention`` uses, so the parameter
name matches the dense phase. It is fed to the block-sparse kernel as its
``attn_sink``, which then enables the finite-sink LSE correction and the
analytic sink gradient. The indexer KL target does not see it: that target
normalises over the indexer's own candidate set, and the sink -- like the forced
window -- is outside that set by construction, not by cancellation. See
``_attn_target`` for the measured size of the alternative definition.

Multi-document equivalence: RoPE/YaRN scores depend only on ``pos_q - pos_k``,
the YaRN ``mscale`` is a constant and the Hadamard ``rotate_activation`` is
orthogonal, so no per-document position reset is needed. Equivalence to running
every document on its own therefore reduces to index correctness, which is what
``_derive_csa_doc_boundaries`` plus the index builders below guarantee.

Context parallel (``contiguous_allgather`` only, as the HCA layers of the same
model require at ``dsv4_hybrid_attention.py:607-611``) follows the same
"Miles pattern" as ``CSASelfAttention._forward_cp``: the query slice stays
sharded, only the low-dimensional KV latent is all-gathered to the global
length, and the output comes back sharded with no reduce-scatter. The index
tables are built over the *global* sequence and then row-sliced to this rank,
which is exactly right because ``_derive_csa_doc_boundaries`` and the builders
are ``seqlen``-agnostic and their column values are global token ids -- the same
space the all-gathered KV is indexed in. ``attn_mask_startend_row_indices``
already arrives at the global length under CP
(``dsv4_hybrid_attention.py:634``), while ``query`` / ``key`` / ``x`` / ``qr``
arrive local but RoPE'd with global positions
(``multi_latent_attention.py:1485-1545``). The dense full-causal backend needs
one extra step for the same reason -- its mask is a *row* bound, not a column id
-- which ``_cp_row_bounds`` does.

    A pure function of ``(attn_mask_startend_row_indices, seqlen)``: no

    stay global token ids -- which is what the kernels expect, the KV being
    all-gathered. Rows are sliced to the local CP rank on the way out.

    ``CSADocMaskMetadata`` deliberately does **not** stand in for this. Two
    thirds of it is compression semantics, its ``build`` pays a ``.item()`` for a
    compression bound, and under ``csa_dense_mode`` -- which the layer43 configs

        Rank ``r`` scores global chunks ``(2r, 2*cp_size-1-2r)`` out of
        ``2*cp_size`` instead of its contiguous ``(2r, 2r+1)``. The ids sum to
        ``2*cp_size-1`` on every rank, and a causal row's candidate count grows
        linearly with its global position, so the two halves' work sums to a
        constant: measured 31x between cp0 and cp15 at 256k/cp16 collapses to 1x.

        **Two calls, not one.** The kernel learns where its rows sit globally
        from ``q_causal_offsets``, one scalar per batch
        (``csa_indexer_fwd_cudnn.py``), so a single affine map cannot describe two
        disjoint segments. Each chunk is internally contiguous, so each call
        carries its own ``seq_offset``. This is the same shape as the query tiling
        the dense path already does (it passes ``seq_offset + start`` per tile);
        only the second segment's start jumps.

        ``vr_zz`` must be the ``valid_range`` of exactly these rows, in the same
        order. A ``seq_offset`` that disagrees with it is silently wrong in one
        direction: too large only wastes work (the extra columns are masked out of
        the top-k anyway), too small writes ``-inf`` over legal candidates so they
        can never be selected.

        The two results are concatenated and swapped back to the contiguous
        layout before returning, so ``row_empty``, ``window_idxs``, attention, the
        KL and ``TileLangCSAIndexerLossAutoScaler`` all keep seeing one unpermuted
        ``[b, s_local, topk]`` tensor. Applying the loss PyLayer per chunk instead
        would halve ``target.shape[1]``, which is where its backward reads the
        row-count denominator, and double the gradient.

        The swaps are not differentiable and do not need to be: this whole path
        runs under ``paddle.no_grad()`` on detached inputs, and the indexer
        gradient reaches the weights through the loss scaler applied to the
        *unpermuted* tensors.

        Both DSA phases share this predicate. ``paddle.is_grad_enabled()`` is
        what makes the loss count exactly once under recompute: the first
        (no-grad) forward only materialises the attention columns, the second one
        attaches the loss.

        ``dsa_indexer_loss_bwd_p2p_overlap`` needs the opposite -- the pass that
        runs during the pipeline's *forward* phase, because that is when the drain
        hook fires. Which pass that is depends on whether this layer body is
        replayed, which is exactly what ``in_recompute`` says:

        =================  ======================  ==========================
        ``in_recompute``   passes per micro-batch  enqueue on
        =================  ======================  ==========================
        ``True``           no-grad, then grad      ``not is_grad_enabled()``
        ``False``          grad only               ``is_grad_enabled()``
        =================  ======================  ==========================

        Both spellings fire exactly once per ``(layer, micro-batch)``, so the
        flag is independent of ``recompute_granularity``. Keying off the config
        instead would be wrong twice over: it cannot see ``recompute_method``
        ``first_n`` / ``block`` leaving *some* layers unwrapped, and it would
        reject configurations that do not recompute at all yet overlap perfectly
        well.

        ``in_recompute`` tracks the *layer body*'s wrapper only, and two other
        wrappers can replay this forward without it being set: selective
        recompute of ``core_attn``, which wraps ``core_attention`` itself
        (``MultiLatentAttention.forward``), and the ``RECOVER_STEP`` recovery
        window, which recomputes the layer body while ``full_recompute`` is
        ``False``. Both then take the ``False`` row, i.e. enqueue on the
        grad-enabled replay, which runs in backward: the branch is still executed
        exactly once, by a later micro-step's callback or by
        ``indexer_loss_overlap.drain_all()``, but too late to overlap anything.
        Cost only, never correctness; ``indexer_loss_overlap.validate_config``
        warns about the ``core_attn`` one (the recovery window is a step-dependent
        environment variable and cannot be seen from a config).

        ``in_recompute`` is ignored unless the overlap is on; the default path

        """Phase 2: frozen backbone, full-causal attention, full-causal KL.

        No top-k on either side. The two halves:

        * **attention** is the same deterministic full-causal set phase 1 uses,
          so the frozen backbone sees exactly the activations it was pretrained
          with while the indexer is still random -- literally the same
          ``_forward_full_causal`` call.
        * **the indexer** is supervised over the *whole* per-document causal
          span, so it cannot reinforce its own initial ranking.

        The indexer half is one tilelang call with ``topk_effective = s_global``,
        which is the "full-candidate selection" mode ``csa_indexer_topk_fwd``
        documents for exactly this phase -- the CSA layers use it the same way
        with ``topk_effective = n_compressed``. The kernel returns the softmax
        probabilities over every candidate column plus the column ids, and the
        head dimension never leaves the kernel; the backward is upstream's
        ``csa_indexer_bwd`` via ``TileLangCSAIndexerLossAutoScaler``, whose
        tilelang branch computes exactly ``(P - Q) * coeff / valid_rows``.

        Recompute: the attention mask is the caller's own row-end vector, so the
        two forwards of a recompute segment are bit-identical and there is no
        top-k tie-break to worry about. The loss is
        attached on the grad-enabled forward only, so it is counted once; the
        no-grad forward skips the indexer entirely rather than computing and
        discarding it.

        CP: ``index_k`` is all-gathered to ``s_global`` inside
        ``forward_before_topk`` and ``kv`` by the caller, ``valid_range`` is built
        over the global sequence and row-sliced, and ``valid_rows`` is the global
        valid-row count -- so the per-rank losses sum to the single-rank one and
        no ``/cp_size`` correction is needed.

        Two KL backends, chosen by ``config.csa_indexer_backend``:

        * ``"tilelang"`` (default) -- the single ``csa_indexer_topk_fwd`` call
          described above. Its two bitonic buffers make the shared-memory
          request proportional to the candidate width, so it stops at
          ``_TILELANG_KL_MAX_WIDTH``;
        * ``"cudnn"`` -- the dense cuDNN triple, which has no top-k stage and
          therefore neither the shared-memory wall nor an ``[s, width]`` tensor
          that has to survive into the backward. See
          :meth:`_warmup_kl_dense_cudnn`.

        Both compute the same objective; the switch is a memory/width trade, not
        a change of loss. The field's third value, ``"unfused"``, has no
        full-candidate implementation of its own and is served by tilelang --
        explicitly, and with tilelang's width and head-count limits still
        enforced by name.

        Same objective as the tilelang branch, and deliberately the same
        arithmetic: identical KL expression, identical ``_EPS``, identical
        denominator convention. What changes is where the ``[s_local, width]``
        matrices live -- transient inside this forward and *recomputed* in the
        backward, rather than carried across by the autoscaler. At 64k/cp=8 that
        is two temporaries against three resident 2 GiB tensors per layer, and it
        is what removes the tilelang shared-memory ceiling entirely.

        Row gating collapses into a single ``row_active [s_local]``: a row is in
        the loss when its document is real (``is_valid``) *and* its token is not
        padding (``loss_mask``). With ``window=0`` those are exactly the rows the
        tilelang branch keeps, since ``row_empty == ~is_valid`` there. Setting
        ``attn_lse = +inf`` on an inactive row zeroes its whole attention-score
        row, hence ``target == 0`` and a zero KL term -- no separate mask
        multiply. The backward additionally forces ``index_lse = +inf`` there,
        which zeroes that row's gradient exactly.

        THD, not BSHD, even though the batch is always 1: the dense op's BSHD
        mode takes one ``q_causal_offsets`` entry per *batch* element
        (``_interface_sm100.py:748``), so it can only express a single causal
        span for the whole packed sequence. ``cu_seqlens`` is what makes
        per-document masking -- and the CP left border -- expressible at all, and
        it also compacts ``max_seqlen_k`` to the longest visible document. The

        """Global ``[LTS]`` row bounds -> this rank's local ``[LTS, UTE]`` pair.

        ``flashmask_attention``'s own ``causal=True`` bottom-right-aligns the
        diagonal: it masks column ``j`` above row ``j + seqlen_k - seqlen_q``
        (``flash_mask/cute/flashmask_utils.py:650``, ``:411``, and the comment at
        ``flash_bwd_sm100_bigd.py:2009``). Under CP this rank holds query rows
        ``[cp_rank * s_local, (cp_rank + 1) * s_local)`` against an all-gathered
        ``s_global`` key, so that implied offset -- ``s_global - s_local`` -- is
        only the right one for the last rank. Handing the kernel the global
        ``row_end`` with ``causal=True`` therefore returns *silently* wrong
        numbers on every other rank (measured cosine 2.7e-1 at cp_size=2, no
        exception), and the document bounds are wrong on every rank including the
        last, since their values are global row ids compared against local ones.

        The fix is the contract the rest of the model's CP attention already
        uses: express the diagonal as an explicit second flashmask bound instead
        of asking the kernel for it, then shift both bounds into this rank's row
        space. ``DotProductAttention`` does exactly this at
        ``dot_product_attention.py:614-617`` (``is_causal = False`` plus a
        two-column mask), the HySparse MLA scorer at
        ``multi_latent_attention.py:1233-1245``, and ``FlashMaskContextParallel``
        rejects ``causal=True`` outright for the same reason
        (``context_parallel_utils.py:1116-1119``).

        With ``causal=False`` and two bounds the kernel reads them as
        ``[LTS, UTE]`` (``flashmask_utils.py:261-270``) and masks
        ``row >= LTS or row < UTE`` (``mask.py:513-518``), i.e. column ``j`` is
        visible on rows ``[UTE_j, LTS_j)``. So ``UTE_j = j`` reproduces the
        causal diagonal in *global* rows, ``LTS_j`` stays the caller's document
        end, and ``preprocess_index`` -- the same helper
        ``cp_flashmask_allgatherkv_balance_forward`` uses for this mode
        (``context_parallel_utils.py:716-721``) -- shifts both by
        ``cp_rank * s_local`` and clips to ``[0, s_local]``. Only
        ``contiguous_allgather`` is localised this way, which is the only mode
        this class accepts (``__init__``).

        Worked example, ``s_global=8``, two documents ``0-3`` / ``4-7``,
        ``cp_size=2``. Global bounds ``LTS=[4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8]``,
        ``UTE=[0,1,2,...,7]``. On rank 1 (rows 4-7) they become
        ``LTS'=[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4]`` and ``UTE'=[0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3]``: document A's
        columns are masked on every local row (``LTS'=0``), and column 5 is
        visible on local rows 1-3, i.e. global rows 5-7. Both correct, where
        ``causal=True`` on the unshifted bounds would have left document A fully
        visible.

        The denominator is **the KL's candidate set and nothing else** -- not the

        oversight: the indexer is only ever asked to rank the columns it can

        its candidate range, so neither the window nor the sink is in its decision

        ``dsa_attention._compute_dsa_indexer_loss`` adds ``index_mask`` to
        ``attention_scores`` *before* the softmax, i.e. it normalises over the
        selected set.

        Worth recording because it was measured and is easy to misread as a bug:
        normalising over the full attention row instead (window + top-k + sink)
        gives a *different* target -- a head mixture weighted by each head's mass

        the uniform ``(1/H)·Σ_h softmax_K(l^h)`` here. The gap is 4.4e-3 at the
        production sink initialisation, 1.7e-2 at ``sink=+3``, and 1.9e-2 for the
        window term alone. Those are two objectives, not right and wrong; this one
        is the intended one.

        Two different head paddings meet here, and they pull in opposite

          unpadded one.
        * The *target* kernel uses the query-head count as its MMA ``M`` tile
          (``_dispatch_sparse_attn_tile_params``: ``m = qhead_per_kv_head``), and
          only powers of two from 16 up work: 24/40/48/80 raise, and ``h == 8``

          is narrower.

        The pad heads carry an **infinite** LSE, so ``exp(score - inf) == 0``
        keeps them out of the head sum exactly rather than approximately (the
        query pad rows are zeros, whose score is a finite 0). Measured against
